        There are currently three viewing types:</br>
        Auto - Instantly switches to whatever game is the most exciting.</br>
        Semi - Switches to the most exciting game if it is significantly more exciting than your current game.</br>
        None - Never switches. Alerts will display and you can choose when you want to switch games.</br>

        How do you Determine if a Game is "Exciting"?
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        We use the sabermetric stat "leverage index."</br></br>
        Given the current: score, inning, base runners and outs; we can use historical baseball data to show what at-bats have the highest likelihood of changing the game's outcome.

      <div class="faq-answer">
        MLB game data is cached every minute. The site is refreshed every 30 seconds to ensure you get the latest update. Refreshing more frequently will have no effect.
