## TODO

* Smarter "fetchAllStatuses": Within so many minutes of a scheduled game, we should try to update that game's status. Or manually set their status to In Progress to allow it to be caught in the refresh cycle.
* Clear cached game from previous days.
* Responsive layout to reduce code overlap with mobile app.
* Tests :)
* Reduce duplicate code
* Authentication
